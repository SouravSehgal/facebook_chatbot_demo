The '20s are roaring. Liquor is flowing, bullets are flying, and one man sets out to make his mark on the world.

Joe Coughlin, the youngest son of a prominent Boston police captain, has long since turned his back on his strict and proper upbringing. Now having graduated from a childhood of petty theft to a career in the pay of the city's most fearsome mobsters, Joe enjoys the spoils, thrills, and notoriety of being an outlaw. But life on the dark side carries a heavy price. In a time when ruthless men of ambition, armed with cash, illegal booze, and guns, battle for control, no one-neither family nor friend, enemy nor lover-can be trusted. Beyond money and power, even the threat of prison, one fate seems most likely for men like Joe: an early death. But until that day, he and his friends are determined to live life to the hilt. Joe embarks on a dizzying journey up the ladder of organized crime that takes him from the flash of Jazz Age Boston to the sensual shimmer of Tampa's Latin Quarter to the sizzling streets of Cuba. Live by Night is a riveting epic layered with a diverse cast of loyal friends and callous enemies, tough rumrunners and sultry femmes fatales, Bible-quoting evangelists and cruel Klansmen, all battling for survival and their piece of the American dream.

The parents have passed their ideals to their children, namely socialism (in its various forms) and survivalism. With the former, Ben considers most of western society as being fascist, especially corporate America. With the latter, he figures that no one will or should be there for you, so you better learn how to take care of yourself in all its aspects. As such, the children have been subject to vigorous physical training, know how to deal with minor bumps, bruises, cuts, sprains and even fractures, and know how to hunt, forage and grow their own food. The children are also non-registered home schooled, meaning that they have no official academic records. Ben and Leslie have tried to make the children critical thinkers, however within the context of their ideals. Beyond these issues, Ben and Leslie made the decision to live this lifestyle for Leslie's health. Formerly a lawyer, Leslie was diagnosed as bipolar. Ben figures that this disorder started with her post-partum depression with Bo. Even with this lifestyle, Leslie's condition has become progressively worse. Despite not believing in western medicine, Ben, to deal with the illness, has sent Leslie to hospital, one close to Ben's sister, Harper, in Sacramento so that there can be family close by. While in hospital, Leslie is able to commit suicide. Beyond the collective grief, Leslie's act brings out a battle between Ben, and Leslie's father, Jack Bertrang, a wealthy Christian, who not only blames Ben for what happened to Leslie, but believes what he is doing to the children can legally be considered abuse. To be held in their church in New Mexico, Jack takes over the funeral arrangements to his and his complacent wife Abby's Christian morals, against what Ben knows was Leslie's wishes, she who believed in Buddhist philosophies. Although Jack threatens to call the police if Ben shows up to the funeral, he and the children believe it is the latest of their missions to rescue Leslie to honor her last wishes to be cremated as per Buddhist philosophies. This mission not only may bring the divide between Jack and Ben to a head, but may also bring out some long seated issues within the Cash children as they are exposed to commercial America in all its good and bad, and as Bo grows into manhood, he who may have his own ideas of what he should do with the next phase of his life.", "poster" : "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjE5OTM0OTY5NF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDcxOTQ3ODE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "118 min", "votes" : "35,111" }

As you read this, a pre-teen or teen, in the United States has committed suicide. Teen suicide in the LGBT community has gained immense popularity on a larger social scale then ever before. While the interest in this social dilemma is thrust into the spotlight none have ever before addressed this social issue in such a manner as Kim Rocco Shields newest film. Love Is All You Need? thrusts its audience into another thought of existence that does more than just acknowledge there is a serious social problem affecting the gay community and does more than just talk about the issue. In Love Is All You Need? its audience lives the issue. Different people and their individual, unique lives intertwine and collide in a world confronted with controversy and forbidden love. This world is very much like our own: filled with family gatherings at church, kids playing in the yard and college frat parties. Except these families are led by same-sex couples, and homosexuality is the expectation. To be heterosexual is to be shunned and ridiculed because it means you are different. In this world, to be GAY is right and to be STRAIGHT is wrong. That's the world of Jude Klein, the star quarterback of the Sparta University football team. While celebrating her most recent win at the Phi Beta Lambda fraternity house party, Jude meets sports journalist Ryan Morris. The two quickly form a romantic bond that must be hidden from the rest of the world. The cold and cruel local priest Rachel Duncan discovers this secret affair, inspiring her to fervently organize a hateful campaign against the local \"hetero\". Meanwhile, 11-year-old Emily is often teased at her elementary school and is kicked off her school's football team. She finds comfort in her new friendship with Ian Santilli, one of her male classmates. Ashley begins to form a crush on her new playmate, despite how strongly her mother Karen is against being straight. These separate stories connect to each other in unexpected ways as each of them struggle with their own problems in this \"gay\" world.

It is the middle of the 20s and times are troubled since the already fragile equilibrium of secrecy between the unseen world of wizards and the ordinary or \"No-Maj\" people that the MACUSA Congress struggles to maintain, is at risk of being unsettled. In the meantime, the voices against wizardry keep growing with daily protests led by Mary Lou Barebone and fuelled by the increasing disasters ascribed to a dark wizard, Gellert Grindelwald. At the same time, by a twist of fate, Newt's precious suitcase will be switched with the identical one of an aspiring No-Maj baker, Jacob Kowalski, while demoted Auror, Tina Goldstein, arrests Newt for being an unregistered wizard. To make matters worse, with the suitcase in the wrong hands, several creatures manage to escape to unknown directions. Before long, this situation will catch Senior Auror Percival Graves' attention who will target both Tina and Newt amid panic caused by an invisible, devastating and utterly unpredictable menace that still wreaks havoc in New York's 5th Avenue. Is there a hidden agenda behind Graves' intentions and ultimately, what will happen to the remaining magical creatures still loose in the streets?", "poster" : "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMjMxOTM1OTI4MV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwODE5OTYxMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "133 min", "votes" : "75,816" }

Angry, intent on revenge and fuelled by alcohol, Harper agrees to the deal and spends the rest of his evening downing shots with Johnny Ray. The next morning, Harper awakes to the mother of all hangovers with hazy memory of the previous night's events. Answering a knock at the front door, he is surprised to find Johnny Ray and his beautiful but distant girlfriend, Cherry, ready and waiting to drive to Vegas to kill Vincent. Harper's claims that he was drunk and didn't know what he was doing mean nothing to Johnny Ray who is more threatening than ever in the cold light of day. Harper quickly realises that there is no easy way out; if he wants to survive this, he has no choice but to go along with the plan.

He made millions creating antivirus software, then reinvented himself as a yogi, a proponent of herbal medicine, and a serial entrepreneur. He was known for his charm and generosity. Then his life took another turn. He moved from the US to Belize and built a heavily armed compound in the jungle, like a modern day Heart of Darkness. McAfee never shied away from media attention and boasted of his libertine lifestyle, maintaining a harem of young women. In 2012 his neighbour in Belize, an American named Gregory Faull, was found murdered by a gunshot. Sought for questioning by local authorities, McAfee fled to Guatemala, then returned to the US where he pursued the Libertarian Party nomination for President in 2016. Over the years, journalists have told pieces of McAfee's story (including the infamous Vice report accidentally revealing his secret location). Here the Academy Award-nominated filmmaker Nanette Burstein delivers a deep investigation that sheds new light on the shadows around the 70-year-old mogul. McAfee refuses her requests for an interview, but continues a strange cat-and-mouse email correspondence for months. In Belize, Burstein conducts revelatory new interviews with McAfee's former associates, uncovering his bizarre behaviour with women, local gangsters, and guns. She probes into the investigation of the unsolved murder of Faull, and learns of other allegations against McAfee for crimes that were never prosecuted. Paranoia runs high on all sides of this story, but Burstein never backs down in pursuing answers.", "poster" : "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BN2RkMmNkYjktMjk2My00YjQxLTk5YmMtZTc1Y2YyMWY4ZmVjXkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyNTY1OTQ4MzQ@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "100 min", "votes" : "167" }

Brandon had always dreamed of playing for the Arkansas Razorbacks, but was considered too short and too fat to play Division I. Undeterred, Brandon took a big risk and walked on in 1994. Written off by fellow teammates and coaches, Brandon displayed dogged determination in the face of staggering odds. An extremely devoted Christian, Brandon never cursed or drank. He was genuinely humble and low-key. He worked harder than anybody, on and off the field, becoming the first Razorback to earn a Bachelor's and Master's degree while still playing. The overly-fat kid who was once an embarrassment to his teammates and an annoyance to his coaches, ended up becoming the most respected player in the history of the program, changing the lives of all he touched. Eleven days after being drafted into the NFL, Brandon was tragically killed in a car accident, crushing all who knew him. Brandon was \"too good to be true\". How could something like that happen to this guy? The age-old question slammed down upon all with terrible force: \"Why do bad things happen to good people?\" Brandon's story is more than mere football. It is the ultimate expression of the question \"Why?\" Greater will provide hope and inspiration as it strives to wrestle with this challenge and find reasons to trust.

While searching for clues about his father, and the home planet he's never known, Gardner begins an online friendship with a street smart girl in Colorado named Tulsa. When he finally gets a chance to go to Earth, he's eager to experience all of the wonders he could only read about on Mars - from the most simple to the extraordinary. But once his explorations begin, scientists discover that Gardner's organs can't withstand Earth's atmosphere. Eager to find his father, Gardner escapes the team of scientists and joins with Tulsa on a race against time to unravel the mysteries of how he came to be, and where he belongs in the universe.", "poster" : "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BNjYzODU1OTkwN15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDA3MTMwMDI@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "N/A", "votes" : "N/A" }

The film goes into overdrive action with the introduction of fictional character \"John Watt\" from the future in 2013. John is a 21-year-old computer sciences student who by fate comes upon Tesla's greatest invention kept secret from the world, the Time Radio. Through this remarkable invention, John is able to communicate with Tesla in the past and experience a world of mystery, intrigue and conspiracy, a world that is shaping the future, John's present. The radio emits a signal like none other in world and is soon picked up by NSA radio scanners which set off alarms as the signals are highly encrypted and unbreakable. Suspecting that a sophisticated terrorist group is behind the encrypted signals the NSA joins forces with the FBI to locate the source but what the NSA doesn't know is that certain people in the FBI know more about the signals then they are willing to share. John and his girlfriend Sara narrowly escape capture, realizing how the radio could be used to contact the past to change the future and unable to bring himself to destroy the radio John and Sara find themselves on the run with the radio from the NSA and FBI all while in contact with Tesla in the past.", "poster" : "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BMjAzNDY4NzA5OV5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjM1OTE2MzE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "N/A", "votes" : "N/A" }

As an orphan, in the care of a careless Stepmother, Charlie longed to belong to someone. And for a while he did, his Nana. Nana raised Charlie, along with her own grandson, Marco, teaching them how to make tortillas and speak Spanish. But cooking wasn't the only thing Nana was good at. She and Marco had a secret life, a duty to protect powerful Emeralds that upon contact endow superhuman abilities. Chasing after the Emeralds is Lechusa, the fabled bruja (witch), and servant to the Aztec ruler, Montezuma. If Lechusa can assemble the Emeralds she will have the power to bring back Montezuma, ending the world, as we know it. Charlie, on accident, was endowed with these powers and after he used them to fight a neighborhood bully; it became clear that in order to protect Charlie, Nana and Marco had to leave him. Charlie was too young to understand their sacrifice but the heartbreak of abandonment was tangible. Charlie grows up. He goes into business for himself, creating an empire of successful car dealerships but never overcoming a deep sense of self-doubt and fear of abandonment. At the same time, a world-renowned Anthropologist, whose career had been spent studying an Emerald in his possession, passes away, leaving the Emerald, and research lab to his wayward son. This creates the perfect opportunity for Lechusa to slide in, gaining access not just to the Emerald but to the son and powers he processes. A power so strong, Charlie is put in real danger. He is now realizing that what he thought was abandonment was really sacrifice. He is called to fight but is so far from ready, he has to be teleported all over the globe to gain the skills necessary to stop Lechusa from bringing back Montezuma and save the world. But can Charlie find the power to overcome how everyone else sees him, transform himself from just a gringo to The Green Ghost?", "poster" : "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BOTk0MzA1ODQ0MF5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMDY4NjI3MjE@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "N/A", "votes" : "N/A" }

More importantly, Utterson is a Victorian Gentleman, who is guided by a chivalry-like code to remain loyal to his friends and maintain his status in society. It is loyalty that drives Utterson to play detective in an effort to protect Jekyll from the malicious and scheming Mr. Hyde. Eventually, Utterson finds himself introduced to a world that he is neither ready to enter nor accept. The story takes place in Victorian-era England, after the Industrial Revolution. Utterson, a lawyer, and true Victorian Gentleman, discovers that his long-time friend, Dr. Henry Jekyll, has become involved with a mysterious and dangerous man named Edward Hyde. Jekyll is a tall, handsome man with a very high social status, which he is expected to maintain. Hyde is a complete opposite, short and vulgar, with an unidentifiable deformity. Utterson knows that in Jekyll's youth, he was a bit wild and may have a few skeletons hiding in his closet. Therefore, he suspects that Mr. Hyde must be blackmailing Jekyll as the result of some long-past wrong doing. Utterson worries deeply that if the secret were to come to surface, Jekyll's reputation would be at stake. However, there is much more at risk then Utterson realizes. Jekyll begins to grow sickly and becomes reclusive. Another friend, experiences an \"unknown\" shock at Jekyll's hands, ultimately resulting in his death. And then there's the murder... Hyde becomes a criminal on the run with an unknown hold over Jekyll, who will apparently do just about anything to help Hyde. Utterson continues to delve deeper into the dark and dangerous world of Edward Hyde and comes to realize that his friend, Henry Jekyll, is hiding a deep and dark secret. The truth reveals an abomination of science and nature. Utterson is given a final choice. He must choose his life as a lawyer and the laws of England, or he will choose the life of a friend and Victorian gentleman, willing to sacrifice anything to save his friend's reputation.", "poster" : "http://ia.media-imdb.com/images/M/MV5BNzRiN2FhZTItN2ZjZi00M2YyLTkxNzgtMmExYTg4YWJkMTc5XkEyXkFqcGdeQXVyMjM5ODMxODc@._V1_SX300.jpg", "runtime" : "N/A", "votes" : "N/A" }

Speculation and inflation are already tearing away at the foundations of the still young Weimar Republic. Growing poverty and unemployment stand in stark contrast to the excesses and indulgence of the city's night life and its overflowing creative energy. Gereon Rath, a young police inspector from Cologne, is transferred to Berlin in order to solve a criminal case - a porno ring run by the Berlin Mafia. What at first glance appears to be simply a matter of extortion soon reveals itself to be a scandal that will forever change the lives of both Gereon and his closest associates. Together with stenotypist Charlotte Ritter and his partner Bruno Wolter, Rath is confronted with a tangled web of corruption, drug dealing, and weapons trafficking, forcing him into an existential conflict as he is torn between loyalty and uncovering the truth. And we are left wondering: in this story, who is friend and who is foe? With the political unrest spurred by May Day demonstrations and rising National Socialism, even an institution like the \"Rote Burg,\" Berlin's police headquarters and the center of democracy and the constitutional state, is increasingly becoming the melting pot of a democracy whose days are numbered.", "poster" : "N/A", "runtime" : "45 min", "votes" : "N/A" }

Eleanor's fight for justice goes all the way up to the Supreme Court of California, and, despite a stormy start and Eleanor's difficult personality, in the process Eleanor and Colette develop a deep friendship that benefits Colette as much as it does Eleanor. Similar in tone to \"Erin Brockovich,\" it is a moving story about two complex women, and the rights of mental patients who, even in hospitals, and even if they're competent to make judgments about their own care, have fewer rights than criminals. Director Billie August, who won the Cannes Film Festival Palm d'OR award twice, brings his incredible directing skills to this moving and important picture.", "poster" : "N/A", "runtime" : "N/A", "votes" : "N/A" }
